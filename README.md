# HTML-THE-FOUNDATION-OF-EVERY-WEBSITE

This document serves as a guide to understanding and recreating a personal webpage using HTML. The webpage is designed to document and display memories through text, images, and interactive elements. It employs fundamental HTML components, such as structured headings, navigation menus, multimedia integration, and forms, to create an engaging user experience. By following this guide, users will be able to develop their own version of the webpage, customize its content, and enhance its features as needed.

## Part 2: Coding the head tag
1. type "!" then enter, a boilerplate should appear that will act as your template.
2. Inside the head tag edit your title as you want, this would change the name of the tab when using the a browser.
3. After the title, type "h1" and enter, a new set of tags should appear. Write in a message for everyone to see.
4. After the heading, type "hr" and enter, this creates a thematic line that serves as your seperation.
5. Preview the html by saving with "Ctrl + S" and right clicking the "index.html" tab in VScode and then select "Show in Browser"

## Part 3: Coding the body tag 
1. Type "h3" then enter, in here write another message don't worry you can go back to this later to cusutomize it again.
2. Under the h3 tag, type "p" and enter, follow it by typing "em" then enter, follow it by typing "strong" then enter, lastly follow it again by typing "u" then enter. Then type in "Browse my memories by clicking the arrow!"

  This shows us the application of nesting tags
  
3. Type <br> after "</p>" to provide a line break.
4. Beautify the code by providing ample space. 
5. Save the file and see the changes!

## Part 3: Coding a navigation area
1. Type "div" and enter, then type"details" and enter, then type"summary" and enter, within the "summary tag" type "Fun Moments" and enter, arrange the code so it looks similar to this

2. Below the "Summary Tag", type "nav" then enter, then type"ul" and enter, then type"li" and enter,then type"a" and enter. Arrange the code it should look similar as below.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69d9ba7a-0d1a-4002-935c-60b463431b4e)

3. Within the "a" tag, type "First Memory".
4. then inside the quoation marks after "href", type "index.html#FirstMemory"
   this would link to the section that we will create later making it jump to that certain id.
5. Arrange the code, and it should look like this.

## Part 4: Adding our section which will contain images
1. Under the previous "div" tag, type "section" then enter, then type "h2" then enter then put a heading title to describe the images you would like to put in.
2. After the "h2" tag, type "p" then enter, within it put another description.
3. After "p" write a "br" tag to create space for the next element.
4. After "br", type in "img" then enter. "src" and "alt" should appear, within the "src" type "assets/" then enter the picture you want.
5. then in the "alt" write in a description of the image, it will serve as an alternative output if the image is not loaded.
6. then inside the "img" tag, type in "style" then enter, followed by "height" then enter, then enter a value of "200px". Customize it as you want
7. Arrange the code it should look similar to this
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd9b4b91-9656-4047-87ca-5b5a9c49d76b)
8. then under the "img" tag, type "p" then enter, within it add another message.
9. then go back to the "section" tag, and inside it type "id="FirstMemory"".

## Part 5: Adding div as spacers

now to use our navigation area that we created earlier we are goiing to add spacers
this will be added before and after our section tag
1. type "div" then enter, inside of the opening tag of "div" type in "style" then enter, type "marging-bottom" then enter a value of "1000px"
2. add this before and after the "section" tag to create space
3. it should look like this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42696b56-5e2d-4761-b2b3-0cdecab09a10)
4. then save the file and browse the changes in the browser.

## Part 6: Return navigation to our starting page

1. within the section after our "p", type in "nav" then enter, then "ul" then enter, then "li" then enter, and "a".
2. within the "a" tag, type "Back to Top!", then inside the href value type in "index.html#TOP".
this will create  a link to our initial "h1" located on top. we just need to add an id into it.
3. go back to the first "h1" and inside it type "id" then enter, then in the value type "TOP".
4. Save the code and see for your self!


Currently the webpage is looking good but lets a little style by giving color

## Part 7: Adding Color and title

1. go back to the top where we applied nesting elements
2. inside the "p" tag, type "style" then we will add "color" and the value is "red"
3. then after "style", let's add a title by typing "title" then type in a message.
4. save the file and see the changes

## Part 8: Adding something more fun
This is for those who are not accurate in their mouse pointers.
1. go to our "summary" that has the navigation area, inside the "summary" opening tag, type "title" then put a sneaky message such as "Click Me For A Suprise!".
2. next within our "summary" tag, type in "a" and in the href value insert a link, youtube link perhaps
3. Transfer the message "Fun Moments" inside of the "a" tag
4. it sshould look like this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90a6ae35-4058-42d5-8a05-567160deba8e)
save the file and check the browser

But on the browser it can be clearly seen that the message "Fun Moments" is a hyperlink, now we can hide this by 
5. go into the "a" opening tag and type "style", then enter the value "text-decoration-line:none; color: black;"
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1065e5b6-ffec-4fed-a8bc-08e5ed5d4b9f)
save the file and check the improvement on the brower


## Part 8: Let's add some forms... why not.
if you ever decided to publicize this and want some feedback from the other users of the internet
you can do it creating forms in which then can send their name and email.
1. let's start by doing a new section at the very bottom and providing it an id called "feedback"
2. then inside it type "form" then enter. the value of the action specifies a URL that will process the input when the form is submitted, for now we are not doing that, probably soon.
3. then within the "form" tag, type "label" then enter, in the the "for" full name as it will be used as an attribute which specifies which form the element a label is bound to, then inside the "label" tag type the label that you would want to appear which is "Full Name:".
4. this is then followed by a "input" tag, additionally type "id" and insert a id name, though it will not be used, then add another attribute "placeholder" and type in the value you would like to show as an example. "Juan D. Cruz"
5. then another is "textarea" tag, and input the values "message". This will be the text area in which users can drop their feedbacks.

After that add a div spacer after this section also add this into our navigation area and even add in your back to top.

and With covers some of the basics of HTML.
I hope you learned something new and you develop your own webpage with your own wittines and creativity.

Thank you!!!
